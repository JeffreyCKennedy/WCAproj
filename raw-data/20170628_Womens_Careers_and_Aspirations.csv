I think our CE has been very strong in emphasizing that promoting women is a job for everyone, not just women.  I think we need to keep normalising flexible working arrangements (instead of it being unusual, or a hindrance), normalising different perspectives and using ""womanly"" traits (e.g. more emotions in the workplace, more consensus building behaviours).  Lastly, I think we need to start calling out unhelpful behaviours and attitudes - e.g. addressing why it's still overwhelmingly women who clean the kitchen areas at work, and do catering for work events.

Our organisation is a good one, but even our leadership figures acknowledge it's not great when the leadership team is all white men, and one white woman. They might have the best of intentions, and be very good, talented, decent human beings, but they cannot possibly represent diversity to the extent that an actually diverse leadership would be able to. ","I do a lot of biographies of people for business meetings (for my boss). Overwhelmingly, the CEs, Directors, and General Managers of New Zealand's businesses and boardrooms are white males.  I often think to myself as I'm assembling the biographies, what a day it'll be when a list of six attendees who are all white men is as unusual and conversation-worthy as the day I write up six biographies of business leaders who are all Asian women.

The grammar seems to be incorrect.,1,"It could provide childcare facilities, have pay rates that are completely transparent, and also report transparently on what career development opportunities are provided to men and women colleagues and have independent assessments of whether those opportunities are being evenly provided.",1,4,2,"The Ministry of Justice is behind the times when it comes to discussions about gender equality. For example, it has consistently failed to take steps to address gender pay inequality and has in fact introduced measures, like an increasing focus on pay based on managers' perspective of performance, that exacerbate the problem. It's gender pay inequality is higher than the public sector (and national) average, and has increased over the last few years.",1,"Studies have shown that when a non-representative group of people make decisions, they make more narrow and less-informed decisions than they would if more perspectives were properly represented. I've seen the problems over and over: decision-makers might have all the good intentions in the world, but if they don't have the right people there at the decision-making table, they make mistakes.","The Government has stalled on acting on the recommendations of the Equality Working Group, probably because it's own Cabinet grossly underrepresents women. I and my female colleagues in the public sector are fed-up with platitudes and expressions of sympathy. The time for gender pay equality was decades ago.  Why on earth should women continue to put in effort despite knowing that employers are paying us on average 14% less than men? ",2,1,dearestsonja@gmail.com,1,-41.282897949219,174.78421020508,-1,

Sometimes attendance of the women events are not entirely supported by the men in my team ( I am currently the only woman in the team) but they do not object to me going. I need to make my own time to attend. I feel AH provides as many opportunities as are currently available within law but I still feel like within law it is limited,1,Because having more women in executive decision making always helps. at this stage we have a situation where a few very select roles are held by women but that the people following up are perhaps not yet actively involved or close enough to help improve as yet.,"I am very new to my role at this stage and have answered some of the questions from my over all experience and some from just this firm. I am also at a stage in life (late 20s) where relationships are not settled, the ability to travel is easy and available and everyone is heading off in different directions personally (career, family, travel etc). It seems impossible to be able to narrow down what opportunities for what are available for me where and doing it by myself is terrifying. The thought of leaving everything to travel would be amazing but I feel like I would be starting back at zero every time I moved or if I came back to ""settle down"". if I stay, I feel immense pressure to buy a house but only have myself to deal with all the housing issues. I would likely get flatmates to help with the money but dealing with long term planning and repairs and having the consistency and assured rental income would not be there.",2,1,catrina.hunter@ah.co.nz,1,-43.533294677734,172.63330078125,-1,

I get given opportunities that normally managers/much more senior people would take on, which in one way is great but at the other day, given I ultimately come to work to be paid, can be frustrating when at performance review time my direct manager seems reluctant to even have a performance review, let alone have a meaningful conversation about what I do.

I wouldn't like to be that sort of manager.","My career aspirations have been shaped by opportunities my mentors have given me, or that I've proactively taken on myself.

As a young woman there have been a number of times where my appearance has been commented on - often in a way that I do not see as complimentary, but rather in a way that makes me feel uncomfortable. Also the numerous times that managers have asked me do cleaning jobs is ridiculous and something that is never even suggested to my male colleagues. I have overheard comments from older male colleagues saying a certain younger female is the office was ""nice to look at but didn't have a lot going on in her head"". I have also seen an older male manager out of work context who told me he wanted to hire me because I was attractive. It is tiring and degrading and it made me not want to go back to work. Similarly, my HR advisor and all of my managers are male and I do not feel confident they would support me should I encounter a gender issue in the work place. ",3,"I am unsure. The manager above my manager is a women and I don't think she is good at her job and I think the performance of my department is very poor. I do think that a female manager who supported female staff in the workplace would definitely improve commercial performance. There are a huge number of female staff in the organisation and I know that if you feel appreciated, valued and supported you are going to enjoy work more and that tends to always improve productivity. I guess therefore the manager would not necessarily have to be female, but I think there could be huge benefit from hiring managers who are aware of and are passionate about the difficulties faced by women in the workplace. ",I have really enjoyed completing this survey and think it's great that this is being studied. I am very interested in the results and curious to know how common it is to experience some of the blatant sexism in the workplace that I feel I have also experienced. ,2,1,bella.huygens@gmail.com,1,-41.305297851562,174.77899169922,-1,

Schools don't get what it means to have 2 working parents, especially if the mother is the main earner - they still on the whole operate like there is a mum at home to get the kids organised.  That adds stress to kids and working mums - neither feel in control.  then school holidays come around....  the best thing to get more women in leadership is to increase the amount of annual leave they can take, enhance school holiday programmes in communities, and educate schools on how to support working mothers - better communication, less notices in bags (that get lost), less reliance on parents to help at school and do fundraising (increased guilt and pressure).

Simultaneously adding income streams from writing, small business etc. / ",Hope to have better-paid role in which I can contribute my skills to doing something useful and worthwhile.,"I am the sole earner for my household, and have been the primary earner for 20 years, for quite a while supporting my husband's former family also, and more recently my elderly father. No-one seems to consider that if a woman isn't a single parent, she could still have major financial responsibilities. So earning a decent salary is quite a strong motivator for me, and I have left jobs several times for better salaries when promised increases for outstanding performance didn't eventuate. Have also moved cities and countries to advance my career. But I have found it extremely hard to build a career in stepwise progress. I need intellectual challenge, have a technical background; also a Masters in business at my own expense, as my interests have developed. Have at times managed staff, but with each new role, it's as if I have to prove my credentials all over again. Now here I am in a rather junior role at this age. But of course I'm not tolerating that - have always sought to make my own opportunities when they don't arise naturally. Enjoy working with people, leading teams etc. ",1,1,1,1,6,6,6,6,6,,,1,"Regrettably, this survey, though I commend it, is largely based on the presumption that the problem lies with women, rather than organisations - e.g. that capable women need role models, or lack confidence, or need ""support"".  / Some very practical changes need to be made, and social norms need to be changed, actively and deliberately.  / Since the 1970s, when it first began to matter to me, we have made almost no progress on on-site childcare. Imagine if we had that. How much happier and more productive would parents be if their preschoolers were cared for in the building (or nearby), and their older kids had onsite after-school and holiday care? / A great piece of research I read recently said that if interview candidates for a role included more than one capable woman (or person of minority ethnicity, etc) then it ""normalized"" the candidacy of women, and a woman was more likely to be chosen. (If the same capable woman was the only female candidate, she was never appointed, in this study.) HR practices should reflect this. Then as more women came through, this would be reflected at all levels of the organization. It is disgraceful that there are currently so few women in senior management in the public service. The approximate gender balance in individuals entering Govt organisations indicates that the absence of women at higher levels reflects ACTIVE choices being made to reject them. The explanation that women take time off to have children, adversely impacting their careers, is simply untrue for a very large number of women these days - and even those who do take parental leave take 1-2 years at most.",1,2,2,,1,"Not a commercial organization. At least it couldn't hurt. I don't believe that women are inherently smarter, better organized etc than men - but it would be very motivating for women throughout the organization to see women reflected equally at the top. / For private sector organisations - emphatically yes. All the research shows that diversity in senior management results in better decision-making and therefore better commercial outcomes.",Think I've made my point. ;),2,2,gandmhallam@gmail.com,1,-41.305297851562,174.77899169922,-1,

One workplace I used to be at, I was asked to come to an interview with the boss to discuss my ongoing performance at work, because I was 'not pulling my weight', (I had clinical depression, and was not able to carry the slackers, basically!)- I had the unions help with this matter- The workplace I moved to was even worse, the boss treated people differently and some pharmacists could carry on with their own little projects which created career advancement, while I was involved with service provision that meant the background work got done.. the other colleague who got to do their own projects were males, by the way- After a disagreement with the boss, any chance at promotion was blocked. I left hospital pharmacy because I wasn't feeling valued by my colleagues- they would hold their meetings on the day I worked, so that I could have 'access' to current presentations, although one I did was perceived as 'unprofessional' - Others would be given study time at work to prepare presentations, I wasn't. The last straw was when I was given time to finish an assignment during work time, my own work that I normally was responsible for was not adequately covered, so that I had a double workload to come back to as well as three people's workload to cover in a busy lunch hour when everyone went to a meeting about a topic that I would have liked to be able to learn about too- I was apparently 'out of the loop' and was not offered an opportunity to attend such meeting- I paged 3 people to come back and help me and not one responded. This situation lasted for about an hour and a quarter- The response was ' We hope you finished your assignment OK' I quit! Since then I have only worked in situations that are safe working environments where I am not at the bottom of the pecking order or there is no perceived bullying culture.
