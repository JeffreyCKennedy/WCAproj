To support the advancement of women leaders, workplaces need to undergo radical change - not just pay lip service to flexibility and supporting both women and men with family commitments, but to genuinely show that these things are prioritised.  At this stage many 'working' mothers are expected to do it all - effectively by pretending at home that they don't have a job; and pretending at work that they don't have a family.  That is unsustainable, and eventually one of those commitments will suffer.

In larger organisations some men and women slither out of doing a fair share of the work but the people around them usually just grumble about it, rather than confronting it.

Potentially move into coaching career development and have yet to decide if the level of leadership I'm at is where I want ot be.,I want to balance career with lifestyle.  Working less or more informally woudl be my goal rather than level of career,Keeping myself interested in the work has been a key factor for me wanting to advance.  To keep challenging myself is another. / And finding enjoyment in leading a team and watching them grow and develop has been fundamental to wanting to stay in management.,1,1,4,2,1,6,6,2,6,,,2,,5,5,1,I work with a good mix of female and male leaders.  The mix of male and female researchers is good and there is little difference in the regard for the capability of either sex.  The leadership development is held up as important and which is very encouraging.  ,2,Half the executive leadership here are women including our CEO so we are already in that space.,I know women's pay and opportunity is limited and I do think that my career choose of Communications and Marketing has meant that is easier.  I also know I have held myself back at times because of my own belief in myself.  Men say they can do something then figure out later how they will do it without needing proof or experience.  Women tend to only say they can if they have proved to themselves and have examples of how they can do something before they put their hand up.,1,1,justinecstorey@gmail.com,1,-41.282897949219,174.78421020508,-1,

Our success is now about enabling us to exceed expectations rather than increasing the representation quota. ,As women we must continue to fight for a place at the senior management table or create business opportunities for ourselves to excel. As women we must support each other rather than be the negative voice at the table. We need networks such as the Wahine Toa network that has recently been established.,2,1,miriame@experience.net.nsz,1,-41.124496459961,174.81979370117,-1,

Working in HR I hear a lot of women who have flexible work practices saying that it doesn't work. Being a full time employee I don't view that women's flexible work practices work either as with the speed of the business they can't always keep up. I think technology has increased the viability of flexible work practices, as it allows women working from home to be accessible and responsive to business needs. Ex They can dial in for a conference call, spend an hour on emails, make decisions which allow others to continue with their work and keep momentum of projects.",1,If they are genuinely committed to their role then yes. I think for highly engaged people then yes they can make a huge impact.,I do think their is a potential barrier around women potentially having less access to informal networks in business.

This is something the organisation is now working on after data about the pay gap was made available. /  / Increasing parental leave to at least 6 months and making it fully paid for parents regardless of gender would be another important step. The organisation should modernise the work place to support working families (not just 'working mothers') so that both women and men are expected to take parental leave and it is not considered a gender/women thing. Given the long working hours and unreliability of working hours in my organisation, it would be useful if it had a workplace childchare facility. I don't have children but I see these aspects as barriers to having a family. /  / Providing greater opportunities for advancement of women is another important area. ",5,2,3,My organisation is working to improve. Many women in our organisation (myself included) have approached management about the gender pay gap and other issues.,1,This is obvious.
